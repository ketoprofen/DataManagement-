# DataManagement-

This is a little python script that creates an excel and the user can write data to it, the user can also manipulate the data or extract it. 
I made this specifically for me, and it help me a lot with the workflow I have at my daily job. Feel free to copy and modify it to your needs.   
At some point in time i will update everything and make a database from where the excel files will be created.
